# alcohol_data_analysis

This is a project 2 classmates and I worked on for our Statistical Learning for Data Science course as part of our Masters program.

We were tasked with finding an interesting dataset and performing statistical modeling on it.

We decided to use a dataset that contained information about Portuguese students, including information about their academic scores, the time they spend studying, how much help they get, how much time they spend hanging out with friends, and how much alcohol they consume.

Our goal was to determine the extent alcohol consumption has on academic performance. 

Please read our project report for an in depth explanation of our project.
